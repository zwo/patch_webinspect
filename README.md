# Enable debugging any App's WebView on MacOS

This is a PoC to enable debugging WebView in any App, by patching `WebInspect` the dylib regulating which App can be debugged by Safari.

The idea is to tweak method `-[RWIRelayDelegateMac _allowApplication:bundleIdentifier:]` to always return TRUE.

As notice from the disassembled flow diagram, function `isProxyApplication` is one of the judgement conditions. Moreover, from the opcodes, we see `bl` is set before test, so we can change `test al, al` to `test bl, bl`.

Just get it done by patching opcode `84 CO` to `84 DB`. However, the location of this opcode may vary in different OS versions. In this example is 0x6daaf.

### How to use

First of all, disable SIP (System Integrity Protection), otherwise, `task_for_pid` won't work. 

**Warning!** disabling SIP is at your own risk, you should make sure your environment is safe by yourself.
1. Drag `WebInspector` into your favorite disassembler (IDA, Hopper, etc.) and analyze, the path is as below.

```bash
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebInspector.framework/Versions/A/WebInspector
```
By searching `_allowApplication`, you can locate the method `-[RWIRelayDelegateMac _allowApplication:bundleIdentifier:]`, where you can find the opcodes to test for `isProxyApplication`'s result, as the second image shown above.

**Or** you can get the address with lldb:
```bash
# start safari
lldb -p $(pgrep webinspectord)
```

In lldb run the following:
```
image lookup -v -r -s "allowApplication"
# get the adress from range range = [0x00007ff927e6692f-0x00007ff927e669d5)
disass -s 0x00007ff927e6692f -c 50
# find the correct address (+ aslr_offset)
```
```c
patch_mem(remoteTask, aslr_offset+0x000000000006c660, sizeof(unsigned short), 0xc084, 0xdb84);
```




2. In your terminal, compile it with make command
```bash
$ make
```

3. Open Safari.app, run with sudo privilege
```bash
$ sudo ./patchwebinspect
```

If the program gives a successful prompt, then you can debug any WebView. This program only patchs memory, so each time Safari relaunches, the effect is gone, and need to re-patch. The following images show WeChat's WebView can be debugged after patched.
